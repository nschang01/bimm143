# 1. Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

## PDB statistics

To read the file we are going to use the command `read.csv`.

```{r}
pdb_stats <- read.csv('Data Export Summary.csv', row.names = 1)
View(pdb_stats)
```

I need to sum all the elements of the X.ray column.

```{r}
pdb_stats$X.ray
```

We are gonna use `gsub` to remove the commas

```{r}
xray_without_commas <- gsub(',', '', pdb_stats$X.ray)
as.numeric( xray_without_commas )
```

I use the `sum` command to get the sum

```{r}
n_xray <- sum( as.numeric( xray_without_commas ) )
n_em <- sum( as.numeric( gsub(',', '', pdb_stats$EM) ) )
n_total <- sum( as.numeric( gsub(',', '', pdb_stats$Total) ) ) 
```

Q1. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
p_xray <- (n_xray) / n_total
p_em <- (n_em) / n_total
p_xray
p_em
p_total <- (p_xray + p_em) *100
p_total
```

Q2. What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
total_protein <- as.numeric( gsub(',', '', pdb_stats[1, 7]) )
```

Proportion

```{r}
total_protein/n_total
```

Q3. Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Too difficult to determine.

# 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

## Using Mol\*

## The important role of water

Q4. Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Including the hydrogens would make the image too cluttered and not show the interaction.

Q5. There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

308

Q6. Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water. Add this figure to your Quarto document.

# 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1HSG")
pdb
```

Q7. How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

Q8. Name one of the two non-protein residues?

HOH

Q9. How many protein chains are in this structure?

2

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure by NMA

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb('6s36')
```

```{r}
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
