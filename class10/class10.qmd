# 1. Importing candy data

```{r}
candy = read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv', row.names = 1)
View(candy)
```

Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
candy_types <- nrow(candy)
```

Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
fruity_candy_types <- sum(candy$fruity)
fruity_candy_types
```

# 2. What's your favorite candy?

Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it\'s `winpercent` value?

```{r}
candy["Twizzlers", 'winpercent']
```

Q4. What is the `winpercent` value for \"Kit Kat\"?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

Q5. What is the `winpercent` value for \"Tootsie Roll Snack Bars\"?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

```{r}
# install.packages('skimr')
library(skimr)
skim(candy)
```

Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

In the dataset the sugarpercent, the pricepercent, and the winpercent variables are on a different scale in comparison to majority of the other columns.

Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the `candy$chocolate` column?

The zeros and the ones represent whether the candy is considered chocolate or not.

Q8. Plot a histogram of `winpercent` values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

Q9. Is the distribution of `winpercent` values symmetrical?

The distribution is not symmetrical and skewed to the right.

Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The distribution is below 50%.

We want to compare chocolate and fruity candy

```{r}
# chocolate_candy = candy$winpercent [as.logical(candy$chocolate) ]

table(as.logical(candy$chocolate))
```

Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
winpercent_chocolate <- candy$winpercent[ as.logical(candy$chocolate) ]
mean(winpercent_chocolate)
```

For the fruity candies

```{r}
winpercent_fruity <- candy$winpercent[ as.logical(candy$fruity) ]
mean(winpercent_fruity)
```

Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

Statistical test

```{r}
t.test(winpercent_chocolate, winpercent_fruity)
```

The difference is statistically significant due to the p-value being less than 0.05.

```{r}
boxplot(winpercent_chocolate, winpercent_fruity)
```

# 3. Overall Candy Rankings

Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on `winpercent` values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

Q16. This is quite ugly, use the `reorder()` function to get the bars sorted by `winpercent`?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```

Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

# 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of `winpercent` for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Miniatures

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

Q21. Make a barplot again with `geom_col()` this time using `pricepercent` and then improve this step by step, first ordering the x-axis by value and finally making a so called \"dot chat\" or \"lollipop\" chart by swapping `geom_col()` for `geom_point()` + `geom_segment()`.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +
    geom_col()
```

```{r}
# Make a lollipop chart of pricepercent
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +
    geom_point()
```

# 5. Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity

Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and bar

# 6. Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
summary(pca$rotation)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

plot(p)
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

```{r}
# install.packages('plotly')
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
# ggplotly(p)
```

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard, and pluribus are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction. This makes sense because the highest scoring candies fall in the three categories.
